So uhh, first thoughts:

- doogster
- cogk

Ok, so literal interpretation is bad. What about its concept?

- experiment
- mutant
- [twice as many stars as usual][two-headed-calf]

Alright, getting there. Let's go deeper:

- dualism
- ambivalence

Woah, that's too deep. Let's remove the pretentiousness:

- two minds
- two hearts
- two beings

That's it! However, it's still missing something:

- two-beings amalgamate
- two minds connected
- two hearts mingled

Hmm. Should we use one word? This one tickles:

- mingled

This one feels great:

- connected

This one is spooky:

- amalgamate

These three words are great. Let's keep going and decide later.
